Exercise 1: Creating a Container with Compression Enabled
---------------------------------------------------------

   **Group Exercise**

   In this exercise you will create a new storage container with compression enabled.

**1**. Log on to the **Prism** interface, if needed, and switch to the **Storage** dashboard.

**2**. On the **Storage** dashboard **Overview** page, examine the **Capacity Optimization** widget at the lower left. It will either show **There are no Capacity Optimization savings to show** or minimal optimization savings. This is because neither compression, deduplication, nor erasure coding has been enabled on any storage containers. Minimal savings may appear for the VMs created earlier, due to having thin provisioned disks.

Exercise 3: Comparing Data in a Compressed vs Uncompressed Container
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   **Individual Exercise**

   In this exercise you will work individually to clone your original Windows VM and add two virtual disks. One of these virtual disks will be placed in the compressed container and the other into the uncompressed container you created in the previous exercises. Data will be generated on both virtual disks to compare results.

   This exercise is composed of the following tasks:

        * Cloning a VM and add Two Virtual Disks

        * Formatting the New Virtual Disks

        * Writing a Large File to Each New Virtual Disk

        * Observing the Result of Compression Savings

Task 4: Observing the Result of Compression Savings 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   **Individual Exercise**

   In this task you will observe the result of container compression.

**1**. Switch to the **Storage** dashboard and click the **Overview** tab.

**2**. Examine the **Capacity Optimization** widget in the lower left corner of the UI.

..

   Do you see any immediate savings reported?

.. note::

    Note: The savings display can take up to a few hours to display. If you do not see an immediate result, come back to this dashboard later to verify the savings due to compression.


**3**. Click **Table**, then select **Storage Container**.

**4**. For the **Compressed-Container** and the **NotCompressed-Container**, look in the **Used** column and compare the amount of physical space used.

..

   Do you see a difference?

   The **Compressed-Container** should be using significantly less space than the **NotCompressed-Container**.

   |image083|

**5**. Click to select the **Compressed-Container**.

**6**. Below the table of containers, on the left of the browser window, examine the values below the **Summary > Compressed-Container** box and answer the following questions:

..

   Is compression turned on?

   How much space has been saved due to compression?

.. note::

    You may have to wait a few hours for a value to appear in this field. 

..

   What is the current Data Reduction Ratio?

   What is the difference between the Compressed-Container and the NotCompressedContainer for the Data Reduction Ratio?
